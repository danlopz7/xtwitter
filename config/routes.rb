# :new en las rutas de Rails se utiliza generalmente para mostrar un formulario para la creaci√≥n de un nuevo recurso.

# Changed the routes for unliking and unbookmarking to not need an ID in the URL, since the combination 
# of logged-in user and tweet ID should be sufficient to find the relevant record to destroy.

# Replies: I created a nested resource for replies inside tweets. This makes sense because a reply is always associated with a specific tweet.

# member is to add another restful action. if it's only one member, I can do it like:
# http verb 'action', on: :member

# In order to find/see any user (him/her self included) tweets, I specified with 'only: []' that none of the default RESTful routes should be created for that resource.
# when you nest resources inside another resources, Rails will automatically expect the ID of the outer resource as a parameter.
# The 'only: []' option allows you to pick and choose which routes wil be created.
# resources :tweets, only: [:index], you're telling Rails to generate the route for listing all the tweets (i.e., the index action) and to skip routes for creating, updating, deleting, etc.

# controller: 'users/tweets'. ehmm need to do more research so I'm leaving the keyword to. just wanted to experiment with it.
